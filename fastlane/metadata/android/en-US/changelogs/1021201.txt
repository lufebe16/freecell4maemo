Version 2.1
Updated libraries/build tools to:
- p4a 2024.01.21
- Kivy 2.3.0
- Python 3.11
Screen rotation lock:
- set on first card selection.
- reset on pause, on long tap to screen and on button exec in menu2
There are now two modes of screen rotation. To switch between them do a very long tap onto the screen (8s):
a) Fixed to landscape in android. Window inside app turns according to sensor values.
b) Sensor directed in android, but the app Window turns to landcape regardless of outer orientation (default).
